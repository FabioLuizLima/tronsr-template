  BitGuild aims to bring blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption to the masses by providing compelling experiences that are easily accessible, all while retaining the core elements of blockchain functionality. Between GuildChat, our crypto social app, GuildWallet, the most user-friendly browser extension wallet, and TronTrade, our decentralized exchange, we’re firing on all cylinders to usher in a new age, changing the way people interact with their digital goods. We aim to break down the barriers of entry and help cryptocurrency as a whole break into everyday use for as many people as possible.

We successfully completed our initial token sale in April 2018, raising over $20 million USD in public and private funding, and since then have moved from developing blockchain games on the Ethereum Network to building applications that aim to drive blockchain adoption forward on the Tron Network. 

## BitGuild’s Mission:
BitGuild’s mission is to empower blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption through the design and development of user-friendly, consumer-facing products where customers are in complete control over their personal and financial data.

## BitGuild’s Vision:
BitGuild’s vision is to enable 10 million people without blockchain knowledge to ‘acquire their first token’ and for every individual who holds a digital token to be a user of BitGuild products.

## BitGuild’s Values:
Embrace change
Put customers first
Be transparent
Continuously improve

## Why BitGuild for Super Representative?
  BitGuild is one of the most active projects in the crypto space, having released several products since its foundation in early 2018. Our goal is to bring awareness and adoption of blockchain to the masses, and we do that by creating applications that interact with blockchain in a simple and user-friendly way, such as GuildChat, GuildWallet and TronTrade. 

As a Super Representative, BitGuild is committed to promote TRON awareness to wider audiences by offering real-world adoption avenues for TRON, TRX, and cryptocurrency in general. As an entertainment company, we are the most apt at pushing new technologies into mainstream markets, and as such, we are a perfect choice for TRON Super Representative status. BitGuild and TRON have collaborated in the past, and BitGuild’s status as a TRON Super Representative is one of many steps we hope to take in solidifying our partnership with TRON and the TRX community.
